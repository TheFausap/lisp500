# lisp500
A mostly-joking implementation of a lisp in just 500 lines of C.

The original public posting of this has been lost, so I searched for it in my own archives and am reposting it.
This only really exists because of oneupmanship and a poorly-thought-out claim that you can implement lisp
in 500 lines of C. Well, you can, but it's not a very useful lisp. But then you can have an init file (in lisp)
fixing some of the problems in usefulness.
